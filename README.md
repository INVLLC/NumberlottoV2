# Summary
NumberLotto is a simple game that I made while learn basic logic in JS and how to do DOM manipulation. I made the design in Webflow and with the help of copilot got some working code to show the world. 

## Levels Breakdown
I started the levels a little harder but the users win ration was super low so i change them to make the test a little easier.
- Levels: (original)
	- ~~1, maxNumber: 20, tries: 1~~
	- ~~2, maxNumber: 40, tries: 2~~
	- ~~3, maxNumber: 60, tries: 3~~
	- ~~4, maxNumber: 80, tries: 4~~
	- ~~5, maxNumber: 100, tries: 5~~

- Levels: (current)
	- 1, maxNumber: 10, tries: 1
	- 2, maxNumber: 20, tries: 2
	- 3, maxNumber: 30, tries: 3
	- 4, maxNumber: 40, tries: 4
	- 5, maxNumber: 50, tries: 5

## To-do
 I want to start collecting data on the following:
- [ ] How many times people win/lose the game?, 
- [ ] What are the most common numbers people click?
- [ ] What are the less common numbers people use?
- [ ] What is the most common selected number by the generator?
- [ ] On what level do people win the most or the least?

There are a couple of design things i want to change like: 
- [ ] Adding a Win or Losing modal instead of the alert()
- [ ] Create some animation to the live counter and background.
